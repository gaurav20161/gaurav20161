### Hi ðŸ‘‹

My educational background includes a Master's in Engineering from the University of Calgary, where I specialized in Computational Physics. During my academic journey, I had the opportunity to develop a sophisticated mathematical model. This model was implemented using Python and Mathematica, and the results were significant enough to merit the publication of a research paper.

I worked in IT operations, as a Windows Server/Cloud Consultant for two years. Currently, I hold the position of DevOps Consultant, specializing in Ansible automation and Jenkins deployment strategies.
