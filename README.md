### Hi ðŸ‘‹

 I am a Full-Stack Developer with a focus on Backend Development.

My educational background includes a Master's in Engineering from the University of Calgary, where I specialized in Computational Modeling. During my academic journey, I had the opportunity to develop a sophisticated mathematical model. This model was implemented using Python and Mathematica, and the results were significant enough to merit the publication of a research paper.

I currently work in IT operations, as a Windows Server/Cloud Consultant. I'm passionate about solving complex problems and creating innovative solutions. I'm now eager to pivot my career towards development, where I can leverage my problem-solving skills to craft useful and impactful software products.

Finally, Looking for a team or an organization where I can learn and develop my development skills.

### What I'm focusing on

Currently improving my programming skills: Spring, Java & Automation using Jenkins, Terraform
